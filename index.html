            <h3>Python is a high-level pragramming language which is open soutrce and object oriented. Python was
                developed
                by
                Guido Van Rossum in 1991. It is presently owned by Python Software Foundation(PSF).</br>
                Python is an interactive language with simpla syntax that allows developers to write robust programs
                easily
                and
                efficiently. Python is an interpreter based scripting language.

            stands for "Python" If you are in the standard Python shell, you can click "File" then choose "New" or
            simply hit "Ctrl + N" on your keyboard to open a blank script in which you can write your code.</b>

                <h3>Immediate Mode</h3>
            </b>When commands are entered directly in IDLE from the keyboard, the interpreter/IDLE is said
            to
            be in interactive mode. In this mode, thype the <command> :Hello" in front of the prompt(>>>) and press
                Enter.
                This will print "Hello" on the desktop.</p>

    <div class="var2">
        <p>Variable are named memory locations whose value may change during the execution of the program. Some rules
            for naming variables in Python are given below.</p>
        <ul class="listofvar">
            <li>A variable name can consist of alphabetrs, digits and underscore.(_)</li>
            <li>A variable name can start with an alphabet/ underscore(_) but not with a digit. </li>
            <li>A variable name cannot have space in it.</li>
            <li>Keywords are not allowed as a variable name.</li>
            <li>Python is a case sensitive language, so variables in uppercase are different to those in llowercase.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="var">
        <h3 class="heading" align="left">Declaring Variables</h3><br>
    </div>
    <div class="var2">
        <p>Every Variable has a type and this type defines the format and behaviour of the variable.</br>
            For Example, if we write x=3.
            </br> It means value 3 will be assigned to the integer variable x
            automatically.
            </br> Similarly, if we write x=15 and then write >>>x and press the Enter key, value 15 will
            be displayed as output in the PYthon Shell. </p>
